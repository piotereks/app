# WebAudioSpectrum Development Roadmap

## Documentation Improvements

### README.md Enhancements
- [ ] Add Prerequisites section with browser compatibility matrix (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- [ ] Note HTTPS/localhost requirement for microphone access
- [ ] Add screenshots of spectrum analyzer and spectrogram visualizations
- [ ] Clarify difference between index.html and singlepage.html implementations
- [ ] Expand usage instructions with interpretation guide for visualizations
- [ ] Document technical specifications (FFT size: 2048, frequency range, sampling rate)
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section for common issues:
  - Microphone permission errors
  - Browser security policies
  - AudioContext autoplay restrictions
- [ ] Include performance considerations and optimal browser settings

## UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Design
- [ ] Standardize button styling - all buttons should use consistent Bootstrap classes
- [x] Implement responsive canvas sizing instead of fixed vh units
- [ ] Optimize mobile layout - reduce body margins and maximize canvas space
- [ ] Implement professional color scheme options:
  - Scientific (blue-green gradient)
  - Heat map (current red-based)
  - Grayscale for accessibility

### Functional Enhancements
- [ ] Update button labels to show current state (e.g., "Scale: Linear" vs "Scale: Logarithmic")
- [ ] Add loading spinner during microphone permission request
- [ ] Implement user-friendly error messages with recovery suggestions
- [ ] Add axis labels and frequency markers to canvases
- [ ] Include decibel scale on spectrum display
- [ ] Add time scale to spectrogram

## Technical Improvements

### Bug Fixes
- [ ] Implement proper canvas scaling for retina displays using devicePixelRatio
- [ ] Add proper HTML5 semantic structure and lang attribute
- [ ] Remove unnecessary Bootstrap JS bundle (only using CSS)
- [ ] Fix potential memory leaks in spectrogram data management

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement debouncing for window resize events
- [ ] Add FPS counter and performance monitoring
- [ ] Optimize canvas drawing with offscreen buffers
- [ ] Add option to reduce FFT size for lower-end devices

### Accessibility
- [ ] Add ARIA labels to all interactive elements
- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation (spacebar for start/stop, arrow keys for settings)
- [x] Add alternative data representation (numerical peak frequencies)
- [ ] Include screen reader announcements for state changes

### Code Quality
- [ ] Refactor inline styles to external CSS file
- [ ] Implement module pattern to avoid global scope pollution
- [ ] Extract magic numbers to configuration constants
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for all functions
- [ ] Implement error boundaries and graceful degradation

## Feature Integration: Oscilloscope

### Analysis
The singlepage.html contains a valuable oscilloscope visualization that's missing from the main index.html implementation. This provides time-domain visualization that complements the frequency-domain displays.

### Implementation Plan: Unified Interface
- Merge oscilloscope feature from singlepage.html into index.html
- Add oscilloscope as the top canvas (time-domain view)
- Include toggle button to show/hide oscilloscope for space efficiency
- Maintain compact layout to fit above the fold
- Benefits:
  - Single, feature-complete implementation
  - Better user experience
  - Easier maintenance
  - Complete audio visualization suite in one page

### Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1**: Add oscilloscope to index.html with toggle button
2. **Phase 2**: Improve UI aesthetics while maintaining compactness
3. **Phase 3**: Optimize performance and add accessibility features

## Future Features

### Advanced Audio Analysis
- [x] Frequency selector with VU meter (Bar, Analog, LED Dot, Radial, Vertical) around a center frequency
- [ ] Peak frequency detection and labeling
- [ ] Note detection (musical note identification)
- [ ] Frequency band analysis (bass, mid, treble levels)
- [ ] Audio recording and playback capabilities
- [ ] Waterfall display option for spectrogram

### User Customization
- [ ] Adjustable FFT size selector
- [ ] Custom frequency range zoom
- [ ] Color theme picker
- [ ] Layout customization (vertical/horizontal arrangements)
- [x] Export visualizations as images

### Technical Enhancements
- [ ] WebGL rendering for better performance
- [ ] Web Workers for FFT processing
- [ ] PWA support for offline usage
- [ ] MIDI input support for instrument analysis

## Development Workflow Improvements
- [ ] Add ESLint configuration
- [x] Implement GitHub Actions for deployment
- [ ] Add simple test suite for core functionality
- [ ] Create development server script with hot reload
- [ ] Add contributing guidelines
